**KubeStack-AI is an intelligent SRE assistant designed to help you diagnose, analyze, and fix issues with your middleware infrastructure using the power of Large Language Models.**

Whether your Redis is slow, your Kafka cluster is unbalanced, or your MySQL database is throwing errors, the `ksa` command-line tool provides a unified, AI-powered interface to quickly get to the root of the problem and find a solution.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **AI-Driven Diagnosis**: Use natural language to ask "why is my database slow?" and get an analysis backed by real-time data and a comprehensive knowledge base.
*   **Unified CLI**: A single, consistent command-line tool (`ksa`) to manage and diagnose all your supported middleware (Redis, MySQL, Kafka, Elasticsearch, and more).
*   **Pluggable Architecture**: Easily extend KubeStack-AI by creating your own plugins for internal tools or currently unsupported middleware.
*   **Automated Fixes**: Generate execution plans for automated fixes and review them before applying them safely and interactively from your terminal.
*   **Multi-Environment**: Works seamlessly across Kubernetes, Docker, and bare-metal environments.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1.  **Install:**
    ```bash
    # Clone the repository and build the binary
    git clone https://github.com/kubestack-ai/kubestack-ai.git
    cd kubestack-ai
    ./scripts/build.sh
    ```
    This will create the `ksa` binary in the `./bin` directory for your platform.

2.  **Configure:**
    Set your LLM provider's API key. This is required for the `ask` command and AI-enhanced diagnostics.
    ```bash
    # For OpenAI
    export KSA_LLM_OPENAI_APIKEY="sk-..."
    ```

3.  **Run a Diagnosis:**
    ```bash
    # Run a diagnosis on a Redis instance
    # Note: This example assumes a locally running Redis server.
    ./bin/ksa-linux-amd64 diagnose redis localhost
    ```

4.  **Ask a Question:**
    ```bash
    # Ask the AI assistant for help
    ./bin/ksa-linux-amd64 ask "what causes high memory fragmentation in redis?"
    ```

For more detailed examples and use cases, see the [**Basic Usage Guide**](./examples/basic-usage.md).
